# Optix Scouting

Optix Scouting is a tool used by FRC teams to streamline scouting of matches during competitions. 

With Optix Scouting you can:
- Allow users to record robots actions during both autonomous and teleoperated
- Display all previously recorded matches made by the user
- Consolidate and transfer data from multiple users to a corresponding web-app
